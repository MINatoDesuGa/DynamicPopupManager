# DYNAMIC POPUP MANAGER

- Utility class to handle in game/app popups/prompts dynamically across multiple scenes
- Currently setted up with Error, Success, Normal(only text) type prompts (feel free to extend as per your needs)
- Based on length of text, the BG and Prompt type icon(if active) will adjust so you don't have to worry about making different UI. [KEY FEATURE]
- Some screenshots of current setup:
